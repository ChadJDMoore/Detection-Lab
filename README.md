# Detection Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Windows 10 VM for log generation and monitoring.
- Sysmon for detailed system activity logging.
- Kali Linux VM for attack simulation and testing.

## Steps
### 1.Obtain the ip address of the Kali Linux machine via the terminal
### 2.Use nmap on the Kali Linux machine to scan/target the Windows machine
### 3.Check and take note of what ports are open on the Windows machine after scanning
### 4.Create basic Malware for attacking
### 5.
